Story tracking.. what's even the point? Multiple columns, drag and drop, flashing colors, accordions
aplenty, shitty mobile interface, poor group engagement...

This project is a playground for building a tracker within the following rubric:

- Simple data structures.
- Simple organizing rules.
- Many ways of viewing a project.
- Minimal JavaScript.
